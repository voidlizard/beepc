Disclamer
=========

I made this stuff in 2009, it was my first project in OCaml,
first project in any functional language and a first compiler.

I wrote all this stuff before I've read a book about compiler
construction, garbage collection, memory management, etc.

Hopefully, it explains all weird things you may meet inside.

The good news is that this stuff works.
